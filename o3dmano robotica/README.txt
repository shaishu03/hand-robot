# Summary

Here is "InMoov", the robot hand you can print and animate. You have a 3D printer, some building skills, This project is for you!!  
This is a hand built for a job (still picture commercial), it was supposed to be mobile but not animated and mostly be able to take human hand positions. Cables or fishing rods might be added in order to control it, but it was not the purpose of this work at first. I am now working on another model(for the fun), trying to animate it, I really would like to do it with computer control but I have never worked in that field. Never used servo's before, so any help is welcomed.

A first movement video. I have to say that this video was not easy to do. I was holding the camera with one hand and trying to trigger the rods with the other.  
I definitly need three hands!

A demo using Leap motion to control the hand:

There is also the left hand model for the one that plan to make a complete robot, Arf, still quite a bite of work though.

# Instructions

IMPORTANT: Before printing these files, check my website for the latest updates.

This is a work in progress, files might change until it is finished.  
Print one of each STL files attached. I did it in ABS.  
Before printing read all this, since the updates are on the bottom, it might save you printing time.  
Find a full tuto here:  
http://www.inmoov.fr/hand-and-forarm/  
Print wriargeV3, wristsmallV3,thumb4 with an infill of 30%, 3 shells, best with no support, no raft.  
Print auriculaire3,index3,majeure3,ringfinger3 with an infill of 30%, 1 shell, best with no support, no raft.  
Print robpart2V3, robpart3V3, robpart4V3, robpart5V3 with an infill of 30%, 3 shell, best with raft.  
Print coverfinger with an infill of 30%, 3 shells, with support.  
You will also need the rotational Wrist: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25149  
And the simple servo support. Available here : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:65274  
   
Big bolts are now printable. (Strong enough for me.)  
You can replace the 16x3mm for the fingers with pins/pegs of filament instead of bolts, it's cheap, easy, and strong enough. It was a suggestion of FreddyA.  
1x8mmx8cm bolt is required for to attach wriarge to wristsmall.  
1x8mmx4cm bolt is required for to attach wriarge to thumbbottom.  
1x8mmx6cm bolt is required for to attach wriarge to robpart1.  
16x3mmx2cm bolts are required for all fingers hinges(I have recut each bolt to adapt to finger width)  
   
Glue with acetone like on pictures:  
Thumb4 flat parts together but Not the tip.  
Finger flat parts but Not the tips(Be carefull not to mix them up, they all have a different size)  
Redrill 8mm holes if needed.  
If necessary reDrill all finger hinges with 3mm drill. If you plan on using filament pegs, redrill at 3mm(Be careful not to break parts)  
Fingers should move freely.  
26/02/12 Okay, I have added parts of the forarm, print without support but with raft. I have already set in some extra parts intended to support overhangs in robpart2V2, robpart3, robpart4V2, robpart5V2  
Once printed remove the added supports and the anti-warp structures.  
Make sure to remove only the added parts and not the servo brackets.  
Redrill the brackets if necessary.  
Glue with acetone Rotawrist, robpart2v3 and robpart5V3. Make sure the servo brakets are aligned.  
Glue together robpart3V3 and robpart4V3.  
Mount the simple servo bed.  
Fit and bolt in the 4 servos HK15298.  
Wire the servos to the exit of Robcap..  
Run from each servos two rods of fishing Braid 200 LB to the tip of each finger. Make sure not to twist them on the way through. When passing the bolts of hinges, one rod has to be over and one has to be under. Add on each bolt a ring2 in the hinge. Set your servo in to max position suposedly with straight flat fingers with the horn set to full pull out. Secure the rods at the tip of fingers by making two knots + a drop of cyanocrylate glue. Rods have to be tight fit between the horn and tip of finger.  
Once all fingers are wired through, glue the tips of fingers with acetone.  
Mount the "topsurface" on the back of the hand with 3mmx2cm bolts.  
Glue the coverfinger on top of fingers. Make sure movement is free with hinges.  
   
Update 15/03/12: Big Cover for the right hand ready and uploaded, servos and Arduino arrived and almost installed. Added little cable holders to glue, and an Arduino support (thanks to Jestin and pchretien)  
Update 21/03/12 I redesigned robpart2 to robpart2V2 due to missing piece of bracket( Thanks Wulfnor)  
Update 28/03/12 you can download the scripts for Arduino to either do the pattern motion shown in the last video or use your keyboard to control the servos.(you need to install serialterm for keyboard control)Thanks to Crazy Jaw for the help.  
Update 01/04/12 of Wristsmall1 to WristsmallV2 avoids the motion from closing too much the hand. Also added holes for positionning topsurface4.  
Update 02/04/12 of Wriarge1 to WriargeV2, added holes for positionning topsurface4 and two cages for nuts at end of 8mm bolts..  
Update 18/05/12 printable bolts, changed "robpart4" to "robpart4V2" for to receive the arm piston. see blog  
Update 16/06/12 I have uploaded the rotational wrist.  
see: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25149  
Update 22/06/12 I have uploaded the new brackets and modified "robparts" mentionned on my blog.  
see: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25465  
Update 22/06/12 Uploaded "robcap3V1" for to close the elbow of the forarm.  
Update  23/06/12 Modified all the fingers2 to version3 for easy mounting, also modified wristlargeV2, wristsmallV2 to V3 version. All holes are ready, and the hinges are ready to be assembled. Rings are already set in the hinges.  
Update 16/07/12 Modified thumb4 to thumb5, oddly it wouldn't fit into wristlargeV2 anymore. added the hole for attaching the cover.  
Update 06/08/12 Added InMoovPowerGlove (Thanks to brianhomer)  
The zip contains a PDF diagram for connections and a sketch to upload on your Arduino board.  
Update 17/09/12 I have uploaded the bicep parts.  
see: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30654  
Update 03/01/13 I have uploaded the shoulder parts.  
see: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40040  
Update 20/01/13you can now download the torso parts at  
https://cubehero.com/physibles/hairygael/Torso_for_Robot_InMoov  
Update 27/02/13 you can now downoload the neck with mechanism  
https://cubehero.com/physibles/hairygael/Neck_Mechanism_For_InMoov/print   
Update 12/12/13 simple servo bed is now the default mount system for the servos. robparts are now changed to robpartV3 to simplify the comprehension. WristLargeV3 is changed to WristLargeV4, the linings inside for the rods is more simple and will not get mixed during pathing.   
Rotawrist replaces robpart1.   
Update 21/10/14 EntretoiseBolt6 to EntretoiseBolt7   
Still working on instructions text...
